# üïµÔ∏è Invoice Detective

Invoice Detective is a Rust library and a service designed to deduce the
recipient of a lightning payment.
By looking at the details of the provided BOLT-11 lightning invoice and
leveraging some knowledge of the lightning network graph.
Invoice Detective identifies whether the payee is a user of a non-custodial wallet, custodial exchange, or something else.

## How It Works
A lightning invoice is a set of payment instructions which has the destination
as a public key of the recipient node.
If it is a well known node like [WalletOfSatoshi.com](https://mempool.space/lightning/node/035e4ff418fc8b5554c5d9eea66396c227bd429a3251c8cbc711002ba215bfc226)
it is reasonable to infer that the recipient is a user of the custodial **Wallet of Satoshi**.

In more complex scenarios, especially prevalent in mobile wallets where
the recipient node has no announced channels nor a reachable address,
lightning invoices incorporate additional routing details,
such as the LSP node public key.
When the LSP is associated with a well known node like [ACINQ](https://mempool.space/lightning/node/03864ef025fde8fb587d989186ce6a4a186895ee44a926bfc370e2c366597a3f8f),
it is reasonable to conclude that the recipient is utilizing the non-custodial **Phoenix** wallet.
